# Hello World!
Just trying out github pages with Jekyll. I fantasized having a blog where I publish writings on whatever's been occupying my mind. The fantasy is not new. Hopefully, the enthusiasm will sustain this time. I try hard to make meaning of things, but absurdity is more natural.  
Amor Fati.
